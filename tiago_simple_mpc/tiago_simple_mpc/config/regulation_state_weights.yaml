#     Modify the values below. A weight of 0.0 effectively disables the
#     cost on that specific state variable.

# A brief description of this configuration's purpose.

# --- WEIGHTS ON STATE x = [q, v] ---

# --- WEIGHTS ON CONFIGURATION q (size is 11) ---
# These weights penalize the difference between the current and reference configuration `q`.
q_weights:
  # Planar base configuration (4 DOF in configuration space)
  - 10.0   # base_x
  - 10.0   # base_y
  - 1.0    # theta

  # Arm joints (7 DOF)
  - 0.1    # arm_1_joint: shoulder pan
  - 0.1    # arm_2_joint: shoulder lift
  - 0.1    # arm_3_joint: shoulder roll
  - 0.1    # arm_4_joint: elbow flex
  - 0.1    # arm_5_joint: wrist 1
  - 0.1    # arm_6_joint: wrist 2
  - 0.1    # arm_7_joint: wrist 3

# --- WEIGHTS ON VELOCITY v (size is 10) ---
# These weights penalize the difference between the current and reference velocity `v`.
# A high value here acts as damping.
v_weights:
  # Planar base velocities (3 DOF in velocity space)
  - 100.0 # base_vx
  - 100.0 # base_vy
  - 100.0 # base_vz

  # Arm joint velocities (7 DOF)
  - 1.0 # arm_1_joint_vel
  - 1.0 # arm_2_joint_vel
  - 1.0 # arm_3_joint_vel
  - 1.0 # arm_4_joint_vel
  - 1.0 # arm_5_joint_vel
  - 1.0 # arm_6_joint_vel
  - 1.0 # arm_7_joint_vel
