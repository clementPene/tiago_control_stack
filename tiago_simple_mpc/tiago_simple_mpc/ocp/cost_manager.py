        Add a frame placement (6D pose) tracking cost.
        
        This cost penalizes the difference between the current 6D pose (position + orientation)

        the pose error in a numerically stable way.

        L(x) = (weight / 2) * ||log(M_frame(q)^{-1} * M_target)||^2
        
        where:
        - M_frame(q) is the SE3 pose of the frame computed via forward kinematics
        - M_target is the target SE3 pose
        - log() is the SE3 logarithm map, producing a 6D tangent vector [v; ω]
            with v ∈ ℝ³ (linear) and ω ∈ ℝ³ (angular)
        - ||·|| is the Euclidean norm in ℝ⁶
